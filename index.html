      <h2 class="h2">ABOUT</h2>
      <p class="p">I am driven to learn and apply expertise to solve challenging problems and teach others. </p>
        <p class="p">After I graduated with masterâ€™s degree in Biotechnology, I learned how essential cross function collaboration was in implementing concepts and turning them in to real products as Senior R&D Engineer at Nondestructive testing industry. </p>
        <p class="p">I then moved to US where I took a role in the quality department at polymer manufacturing firm where I focused on growing my team and improving cross functional collaboration between sales, operations, logistics, and purchasing.</p>
        <p class="p">Over the next 5 years, I not only grew to become the manager of the quality department, but also took on the role of Director of R&D creating recipes for thermoplastic elastomers. </p>

        <p class="p">Outside of work, Poonam enjoys exploring the wilderness, travelling, spending time with family and continuing to learn new skills.</p>
